# interview-street
A project similar to interview-street (now a days [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)) and [codepad.org](http://codepad.org/) I build it as my final year college project in 2011. It's more like a `Résumé Manager` for a college, where jobs and internships are posted by `Placement Co-ordinators`.

## Key Functionalities
#### Job portal (Resume Manager)
- A `Placement Co-ordinators` can post the profiles and requirments of a campus-visiting company and students can apply.
- A `Student` update and maintain his/her profile with personal, academics and extra-curriculum details and can see the list of visiting companies, the criteria for applying to it.
- A `Comapnay` can see the list of all students who have applied, import their resumes to shortlist
 

#### Online Compiler
- An `Admin` can post problems public to students and set it's resource limit (execution time, etc)
- A student can use this to compile and check output of his/her code on this lik (http://ideone.com/)
- A student can solve the public problems or problems posted by a campus-viting-company for hiring. 
- A company can post their problems statements for student to solve and also can view what kind of codes have been compiled by the student to judge his/her cding skills.
 

#### Forum
- `Calendar` where you can glance over a period of a month to see which companies are visiting the campus? In how many of them, you are eligible, etc.
- `Discussion` where you can discuss about how to prepare for a company and share related stuff
