### Database (oprp):

* MySQL: change the `/oprp/_php/config.php` to use DB_TYPE as **"mysql"**
    * create a schema in mysql by running `create schema oprp;` in phpmyadmin or in mysql-workbench or through mysql-cli.
    * import oprp.sql in mysql db by running: `mysql -uroot -pYOUR-ROOT-PASSWORD oprp < oprp.sql` 
    * edit \_php/config.php and change `DB_USER` `DB_PASS` with your db user and password
    * change your admin email and password in oprp.user table by running: `update oprp.user set username="admin", email = "abc@xyz.com", password=sha("password") where user_id = 1;`. default is admin:password
* SQLite **(Preferred)**: change the /oprp/_php/confog.php to use DB_TYPE as **"sqlite"**
    * Rest nothing has to be changed as the application uses embedded sqlite with the `oprp.sqlite` file

### Web Server

* Apache/Nginx
    * make sure your apache server is running
    * put `oprp` folder into `/var/www/html` (or in htdocs folder for XAMPP users)
    * open `http://localhost/` in your browser and use `admin` and `password` to login in admin panel.


* PHP Development Server **(Preferred)**
    * go inside oprp folder
    * Add port `8000` for `ABS_PATH` in `/oprp/_php/config.php`
    * run ```php -S localhost:8000``` to run the web server
    * open `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser and use `admin` and `password` to login in admin panel.
